SUMMARY = "Python cbor"
DESCRIPTION = "An implementation of RFC 7049 - Concise Binary Object \
               Representation (CBOR). \
               CBOR is comparable to JSON, has a superset of JSONâ€™s ability, \
               but serializes to a binary format which is smaller and faster \
               to generate and parse."
